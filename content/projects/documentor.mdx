## Why this project?
I wanted to see if I could create a Documentation site from scratch using some helpful libraries, rather than using existing documentation framweworks, such as Nextra or Wiki.js. In the hope this would help me understand more around MDX as well as aiming to improve my own documentation process. This project was aimed at producing project documentation for various projects with different level of detail for each.

## Features

- **MDX Support**: Write content in MDX format.
- **Custom Components**: Use custom components in your MDX files.
- **Multi Project Support**: Allow for documentation to be added for multiple projects.
- **Authentication**: To secure access to documentation.

## Technologies

- **NextJs**: A React framework for building static and dynamic websites.
- **Contentlayer**: SDK that validates and transforms your content into type-safe JSON data.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs.
- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication for Next.js using Azure Provider.
