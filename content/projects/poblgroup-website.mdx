## About this project
The organisation wanted to update their public facing website to provide a better user experience for potential customers and stakeholders. Their old solution was built using WordPress and was very cluttered with content that was out dated and not maintained. 

The business reached out to an external branding company ([Toward](https://toward.studio/)) to help with the design with an in house team (myself and another colleague) to develop the website along with a new customer portal. 


## Features

- **Modern Website**: New look and feel with a clean looking design.
- **Headless CMS**: Easy to use cms for staff to maintain content.
- **Page Builder**: Allow staff to easily build site pages they want them. 
- **Page Preview**: Provide users to preview their page before publishing.
- **Customer Portal**: Ability for housing customers to be able to self serve.
- **Integerate into Dynamics CRM**: Real time updates sent and received from organisations CRM system.

## Technologies

- **NextJs**: A React framework for building static and dynamic websites.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs.
- **Strapi**: Customisable headless CMS solution (self hosted).
- **Azure & Docker**: Hosting platform and deployement with CI/CD.
- **NodeJs with Exress**: For developing a RESTful API to allow for integration with Dynamics and other 3rd party applications.

## Challenges and Solutions

<Collapsible title="Challenge 1: Multi-environment Deployment with Docker">
At the outset, we recognized the need for a staging environment to facilitate iterative feature sign-offs throughout the project. This staging environment would also support ongoing development after the website’s initial launch. To achieve this, we implemented a structured approach to manage multiple environments using Docker, with the following project folder organization:

```
├── actions
├── app
├── docker
│   ├── production
│   │   ├── Dockerfile
│   │   └── docker-compose.yml
│   ├── staging
│   │   ├── Dockerfile
│   │   └── docker-compose.yml
├── components
├── .env.local
├── .env.staging
├── .env.production
└── Makefile
```

This structure allowed us to leverage corresponding .env files in each Dockerfile to set environment-specific variables reliably.

```Dockerfile
FROM base AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps --link /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --link . .
COPY --link .env.staging .env.production
RUN yarn build
```

To streamline the process of building Docker images and managing containers for each environment, we utilized a Makefile in conjunction with docker compose. This approach enabled the execution of build and deployment commands directly from the project’s root directory, reducing complexity and improving efficiency. 

```Makefile
.PHONY: build-staging
build-staging:
	docker compose -f docker/staging/docker-compose.yml build

.PHONY: start-staging
start-staging:
	docker compose -f docker/staging/docker-compose.yml up -d

.PHONY: stop-staging
stop-staging:
	docker compose -f docker/staging/docker-compose.yml down
```

For instance, building the Docker image for the staging environment could be accomplished simply by running:

```bash
make build-staging
```

This setup not only facilitated faster image builds but also provided a robust and repeatable process for deploying and maintaining multiple environments seamlessly.

<Collapsible title="Challenge 2: Implementing Page Previews from a Headless CMS">

To ensure users could preview their content changes before publishing, we sought to implement a preview feature for our website. However, existing plugins in the Strapi marketplace did not meet our requirements, so we developed a custom plugin tailored to our needs. This involved creating a Strapi plugin and integrating it with our frontend to render draft data effectively.

> ⚠️ Note: Implementing this feature involved multiple steps. Below, we highlight key lessons and code snippets. Full implementation details can be found in the GitHub repository linked above.

---

#### Plugin Development

We began by scaffolding a custom Strapi plugin (refer to the Strapi documentation for detailed instructions on creating a plugin). The next step was to create a user interface component to trigger the preview functionality. This component, PreviewLink, allows users to preview content for specific collections.

```jsx
const PreviewLink = () => {
  const { slug, modifiedData } = useCMEditViewDataManager();
  let type;
  let showPreview = false;

  // Chossing which collections can have this feature enabled
  switch (slug) {
    case "api::post.post":
      type = "post";
      showPreview = true;
      break;
    case "api::page.page":
      type = "page";
      showPreview = true;
      break;
    default:
      break;
  }

  return (
    <>
      {showPreview && (
        <Box paddingTop={5}>
          <Typography variant="sigma" textColor="neutral600" id="preview label">
            Page Preview
          </Typography>
          <Box paddingTop={2}>
            <Divider />
          </Box>
          <LinkButton
            size="S"
            startIcon={<Eye />}
            onClick={() => handlePreview(modifiedData, type)}
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            title="page preview"
            style={{
              width: "100%",
              marginTop: "1rem",
              textDecoration: "none",
              display: "flex",
              justifyContent: "center",
              cursor: "pointer",
            }}
          >
            Page Preview
          </LinkButton>
        </Box>
      )}
    </>
  );
};
```

The button triggers the handlePreview function, which creates a new preview record in the database.

---

#### Preview Handling

The handlePreview function deletes any previous preview records for the given content and creates a new record using the modified data entered by the user. It then redirects the user to the frontend application with a unique secret to fetch and display the draft content.

```js
const handlePreview = async (modifiedData, type) => {
  // Delete any previous records for this collection record id
  await deletePreviousPreviews(modifiedData.id, type);

  // Create a new record with the 'modifiedData' - this will be the new data entered into the form by the user
  const { data } = await createPreviewRecord(modifiedData, type);

  // Redirect the user to our frontend application with the secret returned from our saved data
  window.open(
    `${CLIENT_FRONTEND_URL}/api/preview?secret=${data.secret}&type=${type}`,
    "_blank"
  );
};
```

The secret ensures a secure and unique reference for fetching preview data on the frontend.

> Note: The deletePreviousPreviews and createPreviewRecord functions interact with custom API endpoints defined in the plugin's route.ts file.

---

#### Frontend Integration

On the frontend, we modified the dynamic page rendering logic to handle draft data. Using next/headers and cookies, we set draft mode and retrieve the secret from a cookie. This enables the page to fetch and render the draft content for preview.

```js
import { cookies, draftMode } from 'next/headers';
import { getPreviewData } from '@/actions/getPreviewData';

const Page = async ({ params }: { params: { path: [] } }) => {
    const { isEnabled } = draftMode();
    const cookieStore = cookies();
    const secret = cookieStore.get('secret');
    let data: any | null = null;

    if (isEnabled && secret) {
        data = await getPreviewData(secret.value);
    }

    return (
        <>
            <PageLayout>
                <PageContent path={path} isPreview={isEnabled} data={data} />
            </PageLayout>
        </>
    );
};

export default Page;
```

In draft mode, the page fetches data using the secret created by the plugin. This draft data is then rendered instead of the published content.

#### Key Takeaways
1. Custom Plugin Development: Developing a custom plugin allowed us to extend Strapi’s functionality beyond existing marketplace offerings.
2. Secure Preview Handling: The use of unique secrets ensured secure and accurate data retrieval for previews.
3. Frontend Adaptation: Modifying the dynamic page logic enabled seamless integration of draft data with the existing frontend.

This feature empowered users to confidently review changes before publishing, ensuring a smooth and reliable content workflow.
